    <h1 id="title">What is Data Justice?</h1>
    <p>Data justice is a concept that seeks to address issues of fairness and equity in the production, collection, and
      use of digital data. It recognizes that data is not neutral, but rather reflects the values and biases of the
      individuals and systems involved in its creation and dissemination. Data justice is concerned with a range of
      issues, including personal data privacy, power dynamics, knowledge equity, and the potential for harmful
      decision-making to be perpetuated or justified through data. It is particularly focused on the ways in which data
      may marginalize or harm historically underrepresented or marginalized communities.

        <h3>(In)visibility</h3>
        <img src="img/data-visibility.png" alt="Magnifying glass next to data" />
      </div>
      <p>The pillar of (in)visibility comprises of two levels: safeguarding privacy claims and guaranteeing necessary
        and
        appropriate forms of representation. Visibility refers to the ways in which individuals and groups are made
        visible
        or invisible through the collection, use, and dissemination of digital data. This involves questions of who is
        being
        seen, who is being heard, and who is being excluded or marginalized in the production and consumption of data.
        In
        many cases, historically marginalized communities have been rendered invisible or excluded from data collection
        efforts, leading to gaps in knowledge and understanding about their experiences and needs. On the other hand,
        some
        groups may be overrepresented or stigmatized in data, leading to unfair treatment or negative stereotypes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right-img side-by-side margin-top">
      <p>(Dis)engagement with technology involves having control over the choice of technology and ensuring that the
        benefits of data collection and processing are shared fairly and appropriately. Autonomy in technology choices
        is
        important in data justice because it empowers individuals and communities to take control of their digital lives
        and
        to ensure that their personal data is used in ways that align with their values and interests. Data collection
        and
        processing can have significant benefits for individuals and communities, including better healthcare outcomes,
        more
        targeted social services, and improved public safety. However, these benefits may not be shared equally among
        all
        members of society, particularly those who are historically underrepresented or marginalized.

        <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>
        <img src="img/Judged-by-Bias-AI.png" alt="People being judged by AI" />
      </div>
      <p>The idea of non-discrimination or anti-discrimination involves practical methods to recognize unfair biases and
        the
        ability to prevent discriminatory practices. Non-discrimination in the context of data justice refers to the
        principle that data should not be used in ways that perpetuate or exacerbate social inequalities or discriminate
        against individuals or groups based on factors such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or disability. It
        recognizes that data can be a powerful tool for identifying patterns of discrimination and promoting greater
        social
        justice, but it can also be used in ways that reinforce existing power imbalances and social stratification.
